# EGEN-310-code
This repo includes code that was used to control our rover.
The following libraries were used to help achieve movement of our rover for the demonstration: 
Dabble Library: https://github.com/STEMpedia/Dabble.
Motor Driver Library: https://github.com/pololu/drv8835-motor-shield.
Servo Timer Library: https://github.com/nabontra/ServoTimer2.
There are compatibility issues with the servo timer library and the motor shield library so the rover will be demoed to move first, then code will be changed to show
its capabilities.
